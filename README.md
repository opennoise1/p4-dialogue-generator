# Welcome to the Persona 5 Dialogue Generator!

Inspired by [Foone](https://twitter.com/Foone)'s [Death Generator](https://deathgenerator.com/), 
the Persona 5 Dialogue Generator allows you to create and download custom dialogue boxes 
featuring the artwork of <b>over 1700 portraits</b> featured in both <em>Persona 5</em> and <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>.

Try it for yourself: www.p5generator.com

As you might imagine, the <b>portraits contain spoilers</b>, so be careful if you haven't completed either game!
